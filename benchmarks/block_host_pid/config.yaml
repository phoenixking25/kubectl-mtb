title: Block use of host PID
benchmarkType: Behavioral Check
category: Host Isolation
description: Tenants should not be allowed to share the host process ID (PID) namespace.
remediation: Define a `PodSecurityPolicy` with `hostPID` set to `false` and map the policy to each tenant's namespace, or use a policy engine such as [OPA/Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) or [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) to enforce that `hostPID` cannot be set to `true`.
